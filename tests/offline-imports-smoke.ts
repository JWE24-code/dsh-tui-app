/**
 * The invariant `npm test` rests on: nothing it loads may import the Harness.
 *
 * CI runs the suites from a bare `npm ci`, where `@deepseek-ai/*` does not
 * resolve — but a development checkout has run `npm run link-types`, so there
 * the same import resolves fine. A suite that reaches into the Harness is
 * therefore invisible locally and fails only on push, which is how
 * `tests/tui-host-smoke.ts` kept CI red for sixteen commits.
 *
 * This walks the import graph of every suite `npm test` actually runs, reading
 * the entry points out of package.json so the two lists cannot drift apart, and
 * names the chain when one reaches the Harness.
